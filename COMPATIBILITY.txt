Unfortunately there are several devices that RKFRead does not work with.
This file tries to list known problematic devices that has a NFC reader but are
unable to read Mifare Classic cards.

- Google Nexus 4/Nexus 5/Nexus 7 (2013 version)/Nexus 10
- Samsung Galaxy S4/S4 Mini/S3 Mini/Ace 3/Express 2/Mega/Note 3
- LG G2/Optimus L7 II
- Moto X
- HUAWEI Honor 2 (u9508)

If you have any of these devices, the app will install but will be unable to 
read any data from the card.

The reason for this is that the card technology used (Mifare Classic) is not
technically standard and there are NFC chipsets sold that are unable to deal
with this protocol properly. There is no possibility to work around this in 
software as far as I am aware.
